            <h1>Sell your home yourself</h1>
            <p>Deciding to sell your home yourself is referred to as for-sale-by-owner (FSBO). The FSBO process is similar to traditional selling, but without the help of a real estate agent. In this case, you’re responsible for the home prep, marketing, showings, and negotiations.</p>

            <a href="">Learn more about FSBO</a>
            <h1>Why sell FSBO</h1>
            <ul>Avoid paying a listing agent commission</ul>
            <ul>Advertise your listing for free on Zillow</ul>
            <ul>Flexibility and control from start to finish</ul>

            <h1>How to sell FSBO</h1>
            <p>When selling yourself, start with home prep, staging, and hiring a professional photographer. Once your marketing materials are ready, research comparable homes to help price your home. Then, list on Zillow. You’ll likely host home showings or open houses. Then select an offer, negotiate, accept and close.</p>
